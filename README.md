This project predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical data using Machine Learning.

# Overview
- Used a public heart disease dataset.  
- Performed data cleaning, encoding, and feature scaling.  
- Trained different models and selected K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for best accuracy (~88%).  
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score 
- Saved the trained model using Joblib for future predictions

# Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Joblib
